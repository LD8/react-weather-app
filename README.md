# Weather App - React

Type in a city and check the local weather.

The app makes API call from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). The data returned included the city name, date and the temperature range of the day, weather and humidity. More variety of data can also be incorporated. Simply type in a city at the top of the app and press enter. The background depends on the temperature of the searched city.
